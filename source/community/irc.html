[% setvar title #perl6 IRC channel %]
<h1>[% readvar title %]</h1>
<p>
    Much real-time discussion happens on our IRC channel, <a
    href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6">#perl6 or irc.freenode.net</a>.
</p>
<p>
    We try to be very nice to newcomers, so feel free to join us, and ask
    any Perl 6 questions you might have.
</p>

<h2>#perl6</h2>

<p>
    We discuss questions about Perl&nbsp;6, how to install a compiler,
    proposals for small enhancements to the specification, ideas for new
    modules - you name it.
</p>

<p>
    If you don't have an IRC client installed, you can use <a
    href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=perl6&amp;nick=">your
    browser to connect to IRC</a>.
</p>

<p>
    If you missed an interesting discussion on #perl6 - don't worry,
    <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/today">there are public logs
    available</a>. These logs also turn many Perl 6 specific abbreviations
    into links, or explain them when you hover with the mouse over them.
    A different logging facility can be found on <a
    href="http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6">colabti.org</a>.

<h2>Bots</h2>

<p>A variety of IRC bots make our life easier, here's a short explanation
of what they do - <a
href="http://howcaniexplainthis.blogspot.com/2009/11/what-perl6-irc-bots-do.html">courtesy
by frettled</a>.</p>

<dl id="botlist">
    <dt>dalek</dt>
    <dd>
        Announces commits (mainly to rakudo, nqp-rx and the <a
        href="http://github.com/perl6/book/">Perl 6 book</a>
    </dd>

    <dt>hugme</dt>
    <dd>
        Hugs users, or adds them as collaborators to github
        projects.
    </dd>
    <dt>aloha</dt>
    <dd>
        Tracks karma, implements 'seen', and has a few more useful
        features.
    </dd>
    <dt>p6eval</dt>
    <dd>
        Perl 6 code evaluation bot. We use this for live testing of code
        that may be of interest to others; it chats back to the channel.
        <code>perl6: my $a;</code> will result in a test against several
        Perl 6 compilers (elf, mildew, mildew-js, pugs, rakudo, sprixel),
        <code>nqp: say('foo')</code> tests nqp-rx, <code>std: my $a</code>
        will parse the expression with STD.pm.
    </dd>
    <dt>phenny</dt>
    <dd>
        Our secretary. Sample usage:
        <pre>phenny, tell frettled to stay tuned</pre>
        phenny will then let frettled know when he becomes active on the
        channel again.
    </dd>
