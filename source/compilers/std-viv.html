[% setvar title STD and viv - Perl 6 standard grammar %]

<h1>STD and viv</h1>

<p>Perl&nbsp;6 has a grammar that can be tweaked by the user. Hence the
structure of the grammar must be the same in all Perl 6 compilers. This
structure is given STD.pm6, the standard grammar. It is both specification
and runnable code.</p>

<h2>STD</h2>
<p>The Perl 6 standard grammar is written in Perl 6, and specifies how a
Perl 6 program is parsed.</p>
<p>The source code can be found on <a
href="http://github.com/perl6/std/">github in the perl6/std project</a>
in the file <a
    href="https://github.com/perl6/std/blob/master/STD.pm6">STD.pm6</a>.</p>

<p>Both STD.pm and viv are included in the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/STD/">STD</a> package on CPAN.</p>

<h2>viv</h2>
<p><em>viv</em> should be read as <em>VI ➔ V</em>, where V and I are Roman
numerals. So it's a translator from Perl 6 to Perl 5, expressly designed
to run STD.pm6 - it compiles to Perl 5 code only features that are needed
to run STD.pm6. However it can be used by other compilers as a base to
produce code for other backends.</p>
