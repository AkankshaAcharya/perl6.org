[% setvar title Perl 6 - Compilers %]

<h1>Compilers</h1>

<p>Perl 6 is a language specification, and just like C or C++ there
are multiple compilers for the language.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> is copyrighted by the Perl
    Foundation, was born and raised in the <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">
    Parrot virtual machine</a>, and is actively developed
    <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">here</a>. <a
    href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">Download or compile
    Rakudo</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
    <a href="http://github.com/sorear/niecza">Niecza</a> is a compiler
    targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET and Mono).  Its goal
    is to explore the static aspects of Perl 6 and the possibilities
    for compile-time optimization.
    </li>

    <li>
    <a href="/compilers/std-viv">STD</a>
    is Larry Wall's reference implementation of the Perl 6 grammar,
    parser generator, and some of the semantic verifier. STD is an
    abbreviation of "Standard", as in "Perl6.0.0-STD". It is written in
    Perl 6, transliterated into Perl 5 by viv.
    It is also used by
    various phases of several other compilers (mildew, perlito, elf).
    </li>

    <li>
    <a href="/compilers/std-viv">viv</a> ("vi" to "v", 6 to 5)
    is a compiler that uses STD as its front-end. STD itself uses viv to
    build. It is actively developed along with STD.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.perlito.org/">Perlito</a>, also known as MiniPerl6,
    is a subset of Perl 6, designed as a light bootstrapping language.
    You can <a href="http://www.perlito.org/js">try it online</a>. It is
    actively developed <a href="http://github.com/fglock/Perlito/">here</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
    <a href="http://pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> is written in Haskell.
    Maintenance releases for successive versions of ghc are
    <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Pugs">published</a> to
    Hackage. The most recent (6.2.13.20110519 as of this writing
    (2011-07-27)) was released 2011-05-19.

<h2>Feature matrix</h2>
<p>To see which compilers implement which Perl 6 features, please see
  our <a href="/compilers/features">feature comparison matrix</a>.</p>

<h2>Supplementals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
    <a
    href="http://use.perl.org/_JonathanWorthington/journal/39530.html">Blizkost</a>
    is a Perl 5 bridge for Parrot, making Perl 5 code available from
    Rakudo and other parrot-based compilers.
