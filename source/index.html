<h1>Welcome to Perl&nbsp;6</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Camelia. I'm the spokesbug for Perl&nbsp;6, the
   spunky little sister of Perl&nbsp;5. Like her world-famous big
   sister, Perl&nbsp;6 intends to carry forward the high ideals of the
   Perl community. Perl&nbsp;6 is currently being developed by a team
   of dedicated and enthusiastic volunteers. You can help too. The only
   requirement is that you know how to be nice to all kinds of people
   (and butterflies). Go to <a href=
   "http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=perl6&nick=">#perl6
   (irc.freenode.net)</a> and someone will be glad to help you <a href=
   "getting-started">get started</a>.
